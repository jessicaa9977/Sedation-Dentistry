# Sedation-Dentistry
Three Types of Sedation
Going to the dentist is an intimidating task to many people, but at our dentist in the West Loop and in Bloomingdale, sedation dentistry eliminates anxiety and fear. We offer three different levels of sedation to accommodate patients with a variety of needs. Visiting the dentist shouldn’t be scary, and with our spa-like services, our goal is to make you forget you’re at the dentist.

Sedation Dentistry
Oral-ConsciousSedation
This level of sedation is perfect for patients who want to feel more relaxed during their time in the dental chair. The medication will be active during the procedure and, as it wears off, there are only mild side effects. Keep in mind that all patients react differently to oral-conscious sedation, but our team of experts will ensure you are comfortable throughout your reservation.

Inhalation-ConsciousSedation
Stronger than oral-conscious sedation but not as strong as intravenous-conscious sedation, inhalation-conscious sedation is often referred to as “laughing gas.” This is administered through the nasal hood and it is composed of both nitrous oxide and oxygen. After their reservation, patients are usually able to drive home on their own.

Intravenous-ConsciousSedation
For maximum comfort during more complicated procedures, our dentists in Dublin Ohio may suggest intravenous-conscious sedation. Medication will be administered intravenously through your bloodstream to ensure you feel as little discomfort as possible.

Between our sedation dentistry services and our Dublin Metro Dental is changing what it means to visit the dentist. Do you want to see just how enjoyable going to the dentist can be? Simply call us today to schedule an appointment with our dentist in Dublin Ohio.
